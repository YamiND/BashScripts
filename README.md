# BashScripts
Some Nifty bash scripts that I have written for very practical purposes

It is my hope that these scripts can be of some use to you. As such I have made them available under the GPLv2.
If you can find some way to improve my scripts, go for it. 
If you have a suggestion about a fix or improvement, feel free to let me know.
I am a University student, so please do not be offended if I do not respond right away as my free time is limited.
