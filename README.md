# BashScripts

This repository is for scripts written using the bash language

I have written a wide variety of scripts that are aimed at various audiences. 

Examples of such scripts are as follow:

1: Post-Installation of a CentOS 7 server that sets up SSH, KVM, and more
2: Script that sets up Apache on CentOS 7 and configures SELinux and https
3: Auditing scripts that compare current locations/files to an image
4: Scripts to Create/Remove/Manage KVMs
5: Script to install a map editor for open source games
6: Script to compile and install a custom game engine
7: Scripts to Creat/Remove/Manage Oracle VirtualBox VMs
8: Scripts to set up SFTP on a debian-based server
9: Scripts to backup LXC images

Bash is a powerful language, and as I wish to simplify my life and the lives of others, the variety of scripts here will increase over time.
