Bash Scripts
=====

These are a few bash scripts I have written to make my life easier. If they can help make your life easier, feel free to use them. All of my scripts are GPL'd so you don't need to worry about me going after you. Money is nice, but innovation and improvement is better. If you think there's any way I could make my scripts better, or if you can help fix an issue they might be having, feel free to let me know or fork it yourself.
